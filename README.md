# AirPoll App
> AirPoll is a young, international startup which is aware of the fact, that the hazards of air pollution will remain invisible without air quality data. AirPoll has developed and placed air quality monitors all over the world in order to provide the largest air quality database.
You have been hired by the company as a fullstack developer to build an air quality app that makes it possible for everyone to check the air quality in their cities.

### Makefile
In order to use the comfy `make` commands you should have the
[Make Automation Tool](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) installed,
but it is not absolutely necessary to get the work done.  
*You can check by running `make -v` or `gmake -v` - each is equally efficient from v3 or later*
